## Repository Structure

- Each project is contained within its own directory.
- Inside each project directory, you will find:
  - **`README.txt`**: Detailed instructions specific to the project, including setup, usage, and configuration.
  - **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python packages required for the project. If there is no such file present then no need to install any packages
  - **Python scripts**: The code files necessary to run the project.

## Common Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>

conda create -n <environment-name> python=3.11 -y
conda activate <environment-name>



### 2. Create and Activate a Python Environment
For each project, it is recommended to create a separate Python environment (preferably using Miniconda) to avoid conflicts between dependencies:

conda create -n <environment-name> python=3.11 -y
conda activate <environment-name>


### 3. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages:

cd <project-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 4. Running the Project
Refer to the README.txt file within each project directory for specific instructions on how to execute the code:

python <script_name.py>
